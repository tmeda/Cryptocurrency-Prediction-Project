Digital currency  is just money in a digital format. Decentralized means that it isn‚Äôt controlled by a single entity like a government. Cryptocurrencies are controlled by a communal ledger that keeps track of transactions in a blockchain. A blockchain is a type of database that‚Äôs distributed across many computers around the world. Transactions are recorded in ‚Äúblocks‚Äù and as more transaction data is generated, more blocks are created and these blocks  are then linked together on a ‚Äúchain‚Äù. Each transaction is checked using validation techniques to prevent fraud. So to rephrase the first sentence,  cryptocurrency is a form of digital money maintained by a communal ledger which is built on  a network of databases that collect validated transaction data. Think of cryptocurrency as a monetary system with a record keeping structure so coordinated, there is no need to trade physical money.')
